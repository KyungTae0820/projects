Taylor Series
The Taylor series is an infinite sum of terms that approximates a function. It is based on the derivatives of the function at a single point. The formula expresses a function as an infinite sum of terms, calculated from the values of its derivatives at that point. This series is widely used to approximate functions that are difficult to compute directly.

Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, the prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3 × 3. Prime factorization helps in various mathematical problems, including finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM).

Abundant Number
An abundant number is a positive integer that is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself). For example, 12 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) is 16, which is greater than 12. Abundant numbers are important in number theory and have applications in perfect numbers and related problems.

Digits
Digits refer to the individual numbers (0-9) that make up larger numbers. For example, the number 245 has three digits: 2, 4, and 5. In many mathematical and computational problems, you may need to work with the individual digits of a number, such as when summing the digits or manipulating them in some way.

Dice Plot
A dice plot is a visual representation of the outcomes of rolling dice. It typically shows the frequency or probability distribution of different outcomes when rolling one or more dice. This concept is often used in statistics and probability theory to analyze random events and their distributions.

Color Conversion
Color conversion refers to the process of changing colors between different color models or formats. For example, converting RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values to HEX, or from CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) to RGB. Color conversion is commonly used in graphic design, web development, and image processing to ensure that colors are displayed consistently across different devices and formats.
