Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows computers to convert different types of documents—such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a camera—into editable and searchable text. OCR systems analyze the structure of the document, recognizing characters, words, and sentences, making it easier to store and process information digitally.

In this project, I have implemented an OCR algorithm to extract text from images. By applying techniques such as image preprocessing, character segmentation, and pattern recognition, I have successfully built a system that can accurately detect and convert printed text from images into machine-readable format. This project demonstrates image processing techniques and my understanding of OCR principles, showcasing my skills in coding and computer vision.
