Chroma Key is a visual effects technique used in video production to remove or replace a background. It typically involves using a specific color (usually green or blue) as the background, which is then replaced with another video or image. This technique is widely used in movies, television shows, and video games to create realistic or imaginative environments by inserting virtual backgrounds or locations.

I have implemented a simplified version of a Chroma Key system in this project. The system detects a specific color in the video feed and replaces it with another image or video. This project demonstrates how to use video processing and computer vision techniques to achieve real-time background replacement, providing a basic understanding of how the Chroma Key effect works in software development.
