Streaming services like Netflix provide on-demand video content, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries, to users via the internet. Netflix, in particular, has become a global leader in the entertainment industry, offering a vast library of content across different genres and languages. Users can watch videos on multiple devices, personalize recommendations, and even download content for offline viewing.

I have implemented a simplified version of a streaming service similar to Netflix, focusing on key features such as content categorization, video streaming, and user account management. This project demonstrates implementing essential aspects of streaming platforms using software development skills.
