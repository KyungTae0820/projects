A maze solver is a program or algorithm designed to find a path through a maze from the starting point to the destination. It uses various techniques like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), or other pathfinding algorithms to navigate through the maze and find the shortest or most efficient route. Maze solvers are commonly used in artificial intelligence and robotics, offering a practical application of search algorithms in real-world scenarios.

In this project, I have implemented a maze-solving algorithm that navigates through a maze by analyzing and exploring possible paths. I utilized [algorithm of choice, e.g., DFS, BFS, A*] to explore the maze and identify the optimal solution. This project demonstrates algorithmic principles and problem-solving techniques to a real-world application, showcasing my skills in coding and logical reasoning.
