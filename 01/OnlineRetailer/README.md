Amazon is one of the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing companies. It offers a vast range of products and services, including online retail, digital streaming, artificial intelligence, and cloud services through Amazon Web Services (AWS). With a global presence, Amazon has revolutionized online shopping and technology, becoming a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing industries.
